# raspberry-pi-iot-cat-doorbell
A cat doorbell based on AWS IOT + Tensorflow 

This is a not-so-simple setup to alert me when our cat is meowing at the back door and wants to be let in. 
If the door is closed, and the cat goes 'meow' while outside, then I get an SMS message on my cell.

Directions
This assumes you have a raspberry pi that has the OS installed and it is wifi-attached to the network
